# Dense Optical flow
These algorithms help estimate the motion vector of every pixel during a video frame.

# Single object trackers
during this class of trackers, the first frame is marked employing a rectangle to point things of the thing we might wish to trace. the thing is then tracked in subsequent frames using the tracking algorithm. In most real-life applications, these trackers are utilized in conjunction with an object detector.

# Multiple object track finding algorithms
In cases once we have a quick object detector, it is sensible to detect multiple objects in each frame then run a track finding algorithm that identifies which rectangle in one frame corresponds to a rectangle within the next frame.
